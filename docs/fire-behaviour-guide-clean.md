# How Wildfires Behave: Key Factors and Visual Characteristics

Wildfires develop an intense, fast-moving **head fire** that rapidly advances with the wind or upslope, flanked by slower-moving sides (flank fires) and a smoldering rear (heel or tail). **Wind, terrain, fuel, and weather** all shape fire behavior. Key visual cues include an elongated, **wind-driven flame front** at the head, **leaning flames** and embers lofting ahead in strong winds, rising **pyrocumulus** smoke clouds above intense fires, and **taller flames racing upslope** but diminishing downslope due to reduced preheating.

## Wildfire Structure: Head, Flanks, and Heel

A wildfire's **shape and behavior** can be described by its distinct parts: the head, flanks, and heel (or tail).

The **head** of the fire is the **active, fast-moving front** of the flames – often **the hottest and most intense area** of burning. The head generally moves **in the direction of the wind or uphill**, consuming fresh fuel rapidly. Flames at the head are typically tall and wind-driven, leaning forward as they race into unburnt vegetation. This leading edge has the **highest rate of spread (ROS)**, meaning it covers ground the fastest, and it's where fire intensity and destructive potential are greatest.

By contrast, the **flanks** are the **sides of the fire**, spreading more slowly laterally into unburnt fuel. Lacking the full force of wind or slope alignment, flank fires burn with **lower intensity and slower ROS** than the head fire. The flank closest to the head's **"shoulder"** can be somewhat more active, but overall the flanks usually have **shorter flames and less continuous fire** than the head.

Finally, the **heel (rear or tail)** of the fire is the area opposite the head, near the ignition origin, where spread is minimal. Here the fire often **creeps or smolders against the wind** (a **backing fire**), with **low flames and slow progress** into unburnt fuel. If the fire is moving against strong wind or downhill at the heel, flames may tilt back into the burned area and **the fire can even self-extinguish at the rear**.

These characteristics create the classic **elliptical shape** of a wildfire's footprint when viewed from above. The fire's **long axis** aligns with the primary wind or slope direction, forming an elongated **tongue of flame at the head** and a teardrop-shaped burn area narrowing toward the heel. However, fire behavior can vary around the perimeter: any segment temporarily gaining alignment with wind or upslope can exhibit **"head fire" behavior**, increasing in intensity and speed. Firefighters must remain vigilant, as even a relatively quiet flank or tail can erupt into a new head if conditions change.

## Wind and Fire Spread

**Wind is the single most important factor** driving wildfire spread and shape.

When winds are light (e.g., <10 km/h), fires tend to spread slowly and more or less **evenly in all directions** (nearly **circular** growth). In such calm conditions, the fire's convective updraft dominates, carrying heat upwards more than sideways, so much of the energy is lost to the atmosphere rather than preheating fuel ahead of the fire.

However, as wind speed increases, fire spread becomes **decidedly one-sided and faster**. The wind bends flames forward, so their radiant heat preheats and ignites vegetation in the fire's path more efficiently. The faster and steadier the wind, the more the flames lean toward unburned fuels, sometimes even touching them, and the greater the **rate of spread** (ROS) becomes. In fact, **once winds reach roughly 12–15 km/h, a fire's ROS accelerates dramatically** – a critical threshold beyond which a fire can shift from creeping to **rapid, wind-driven runs**. At very high wind speeds, a wildfire's forward advance can become extreme: for example, Australian grassfires have been observed moving on the order of **15–20 km/h** under strong wind conditions.

As wind pushes the fire, the overall **fire perimeter becomes elongated**, with a well-defined head moving with the wind and narrower flanks and a tapering rear. Stronger winds result in a longer, narrower fire **footprint**, concentrating energy at the leading edge (head). Meanwhile, the flanks receive less wind, so they burn with lower flames and spread more slowly. Wind also influences flame behavior: in high winds, flames at the head will be noticeably **angled** and close to the ground, dramatically increasing heat transfer to fuels ahead. In contrast, in light winds, flames will burn more **vertically** upward, with less convective heat reaching new fuel.

### Spotting and Ember Transport

Another **critical effect of wind is "spotting."** Wind can lift burning embers (firebrands) like bits of bark, twigs, or leaves into the air and deposit them **downwind of the main fire**, starting new ignitions ahead of the front. This process can produce **spot fires** at varying distances: in typical conditions, embers might carry **tens to hundreds of meters** ahead of a fire, slightly enlarging its perimeter. But under extreme conditions, especially with dry fuels and strong winds, embers from eucalypt fires have ignited new fires **several kilometers** ahead – Australian bushfires have documented **spot fires 30 km in front of the head fire** when conditions are severe. The faster and more turbulent the wind, the farther burning debris can travel. These **long-range spot fires** create **multiple new ignition points**, rapidly expanding the fire and making containment very difficult.

In **grassland fires**, spotting is typically less extensive – wind may roll burning tumbleweeds, dry manure, or detached grass clumps a short distance (dozens of meters) ahead of the fire, but these usually don't propagate far or outrun the main fire. However, if even a few trees or shrubs are present in grassland, they can act as sources of lofted embers that **greatly increase spotting distance** compared to an open field.

In summary, **wind increases wildfire speed, directs its shape, bends flames forward, and flings embers beyond containment lines**, all of which must be depicted when visualizing a wind-driven blaze.

## Topography and Slope Effects

**Topography – especially slope – is another powerful influence** on wildfire behavior.

**Fires move faster uphill** for similar reasons that wind pushes fires: on a slope, flames and convective heat rise *directly into the fuel above* the fire, preheating and igniting it more readily. The steeper the hill, the more directly the flames bathe the upslope vegetation. As a result, **every 10° of upslope can double the fire's rate of spread**, a relationship that holds roughly up to about a 30° slope. In practical terms, a fire that might advance ~100 m in 5 minutes on flat ground could cover **200 m on a 10° slope and 400 m on a 20° slope** under the same conditions. The **heat rising along the slope preheats vegetation** farther ahead, so flames race uphill and can reach upslope *before* lower areas burn out (often observed as fire rapidly climbing hillsides).

Conversely, **fires slow down on downhill slopes**. Downward-moving flames tend to rise away from the fuel, reducing preheating. As a rule, a steep **downslope can halve the spread rate** compared to flat ground (i.e., a 20° downhill slope might slow a fire's ROS by ~50%). In some cases, a **fire backing down a steep slope or against the wind can burn with very low intensity or even go out** at the heel. Firefighters often take advantage of this by attacking a fire from the uphill side or establishing control lines along ridgetops, as fires naturally lose momentum moving downslope.

However, **canyons and gullies can complicate fire spread** – fire in a steep gulch can preheat the slopes above and create a dangerous chimney-like effect, rapidly carrying flames upslope. Additionally, topography can channel wind, causing sudden changes in direction or speed as winds accelerate through mountain passes or around terrain features.

All these terrain effects are critical for realistic wildfire visualization: one should depict fire roaring uphill with towering flames, but creeping slowly downhill with shorter flames and more smoke than flame at the rear.

## Fuel Type, Load, and Arrangement

The nature of the **fuel** (vegetation) feeding a wildfire has a profound impact on its behavior. In wildfire science, **fuel "type"** refers to the kind of vegetation (e.g., grass, shrubs, pine forest, eucalyptus forest), **fuel load** means the amount of burnable material (typically measured in tons per hectare), and **fuel arrangement** describes how that fuel is distributed (horizontal continuity, vertical layering, compactness, etc.). These factors influence how hot and fast a fire burns:

### Fine vs. Coarse Fuels

Light, fine fuels like dry grass, leaf litter, pine needles, or twigs have **high surface-area-to-volume ratios** and ignite easily, leading to **rapid, flashy spread** of fire. Fires in cured grass or shrubs can erupt and spread quickly, but typically produce lower-intensity flames (less heat per unit length) than forest fires because grass carries less total fuel per area. In contrast, **heavy fuels** like logs or densely packed leaf litter burn more slowly (requiring more heat to ignite) but can release enormous heat once involved. More fuel (higher load) generally means a **more intense fire with larger flames** and longer burning duration at any given point. For example, a forest with 20 t/ha of dry fuel can sustain much larger flames and energy release than a light grassland with 2 t/ha.

### Fuel Continuity and Arrangement

Continuous, widespread fuels allow fire to spread **uninterrupted**, while patchy or discontinuous fuels can slow or even stop a fire's advance. In grasslands, if grasses are clumped with bare soil gaps (discontinuous fuel), the fire might need windborne embers to jump between clumps. In forests, a heavy accumulation of surface litter combined with **"ladder fuels"** (shrubs or small trees that carry fire into the canopy) can lead to **crown fires** – where flames climb into the treetops. By contrast, well-spaced or **compacted fuels** burn less efficiently; e.g., packed needles or wet logs may smolder rather than flame, limiting the fire's spread rate.

### Fuel Moisture

Even a large volume of fuel will not burn well if it's wet. **Moisture in plants and dead fuel absorbs heat**, so **damp or green fuels burn much more slowly** (or not at all) compared to dry fuels. Live vegetation usually contains a lot of moisture (fresh living grass can hold over *ten times* more water than an equivalent weight of very dry dead grass). Wildfires generally won't sustain themselves in grasses until they're at least ~30% cured/dry (i.e., 70% or less live moisture content). Similarly, in eucalyptus forest, **fine fuels above ~25–30% moisture** are very difficult to ignite and sustain combustion. In contrast, when fuels are critically dry – e.g., dead grass at <10% moisture content or drought-cured leaves – even a small spark can ignite a fast-moving fire.

**Low fuel moisture and high temperature** produce erratic, extreme fire behavior, with faster spread and intense flames, because little heat is lost to evaporating water. High winds, low humidity, and high temperatures together create the most dangerous conditions: fuels become tinder-dry and any fire that starts can spread quickly and intensely.

## Weather Effects

**Weather** factors play a pivotal role. **Temperature and humidity** drive fuel moisture: hot temperatures and low relative humidity **dry out fuels**, increasing flammability. A heatwave or drought leads to very low fuel moisture and can create severe wildfire conditions. Likewise, a sudden drop in humidity or rise in temperature (for instance, when a dry cold front arrives) can rapidly lower fine fuel moisture within **1–2 hours**, causing a tame fire to flare into an intense one.

On the flip side, higher humidity or recent rain will dampen fuels and moderate fire activity – a fire might smolder or creep in moist conditions that would otherwise halt its spread. Firefighters monitor weather closely, as shifts like **cold fronts** not only bring new wind directions but also changing humidity and temperature, which can briefly make fires behave erratically until fuels adapt to the new conditions.

## Rate of Spread (ROS) and Spread Patterns

**Rate of spread (ROS)** is how fast the fire moves, usually given in **kilometers per hour (km/h)** of the forward-progressing front. It is a core output of fire behavior models and critical for predicting fire growth. ROS is highest at the head fire, which typically aligns with wind or uphill slope, but different parts of a fire have different ROS: the **forward ROS** at the head vs. the **flanking ROS** vs. the **backing ROS** at the heel. The head fire's forward ROS is usually many times the backing ROS. For example, a head fire might race through grass at 5 km/h or more, while the backing fire creeps opposite the wind at a small fraction of that speed (often almost stationary by comparison).

Under extreme conditions, unprecedented ROS have been recorded – some fires during Australia's worst "firestorm" events (such as **Black Saturday 2009**) spread so fast that models underestimated their speed by a factor of 2–3. In any given fire, **ROS is not static**; it can change rapidly with weather and terrain. A shift in wind direction can transform a slow-moving flank into a new head, sharply **increasing the ROS and fire width** in minutes.

**Wider fire fronts** generally spread faster than narrow ones, because a broad head exposes more fire to the upwind unburned fuel at once. This is why a sudden wind change that turns a long flank into the head can create an explosive, fast-moving front covering a wide area. In visual terms, one might depict a previously long, narrow fireline suddenly *fanning out* into a much broader wall of flame when the wind shifts.

The combined effects of wind, slope, and fuels lead to characteristic **spread patterns**. In steady wind and uniform fuel, the classic shape is an **elongated ellipse**, with the head fire at the downwind end, as mentioned earlier. If multiple fires converge or **merge (fire coalescence)**, they can form larger fire fronts or "finger" patterns. Large fires can even create their own wind patterns and turbulent vortices (fire whirls) that further distort the spread pattern.

All these factors can be incorporated when generating realistic imagery of wildfires: for example, a **wind-driven wildfire on flat grassland** might show a very fast-moving, narrow flame front with a long smoke plume, whereas a **fire in heavy forest** on varied terrain might show slower movement but potential for **crowning** on slopes and intense localized swirl patterns.

## Flame Height and Fire Intensity

**Flame height** is the vertical distance from the ground to the tip of the flames in a fire. It is one of the most vivid indicators of fire intensity. In general, **taller flames mean a more intense fire**, since more heat is being released. Flame height depends on fuel, wind, and slope: for example, an open **grassfire might produce flame heights of 3–5 m in strong winds**, whereas a fire in drought-dried forest can have flames reaching the **tree canopies (10+ m)** or even forming **towering flame columns in a crown fire**. In grasslands, flame heights are typically less than their lengths because the wind bends flames over; a fast grassfire at ~20 km/h might have ~4 m **average flame heights in natural (tall, ungrazed) pasture**, less in shorter grass. For instance, at 10 km/h ROS a natural pasture might see ~3.6 m flames, but a closely cropped pasture ("eaten out" fuel) only ~0.7 m.

In forests, flame heights can vary from a few meters in a surface fire to over 30 m if the fire "crowns" (spreads through tree tops). Once flames exceed ~15 m and reach the forest canopy, the fire is essentially a **crown fire** and flame height measurements become less meaningful because the entire forest canopy may be involved. Crown fires are among the most intense and dangerous fires, often spreading 2–3 times faster than surface fires and showering burning embers over vast areas.

**Fireline intensity** – the heat energy output per meter of fire front (in kW/m) – is closely related to flame length and height. For example, a flame height of ~3 m in a grassfire corresponds to an intensity on the order of thousands of kW/m, which is near the limit for direct human suppression. Extremely intense fires (with flame heights over 10 m and tens of thousands of kW/m of energy) are nearly impossible to control directly. Such fires produce blinding ash and **thick convection columns of smoke**, often with a **dark, towering pyrocumulus cloud overhead** (indicating the tremendous heat and moisture release).

Any realistic depiction of a high-intensity wildfire should show **large, well-developed smoke plumes** and a wide, severe flame front at the head.

## Pyrocumulus Clouds and Atmospheric Effects

Under extreme conditions, wildfires can create their own weather. A signature feature of intense fires is the development of **pyrocumulus** clouds – **towering, cauliflower-shaped clouds** that form when a fire's hot, moisture-laden smoke rises and cools, condensing into a cumulus cloud above the fire. These **"fire clouds"** often look like a dirty white or brown thunderhead hovering over the blaze. They indicate a very strong convective updraft from the fire, typically seen on days with an **unstable atmosphere** (when air readily rises).

If the fire is powerful enough and conditions are right, a pyrocumulus can evolve into a **pyrocumulonimbus (PyroCb)** – essentially a **thunderstorm formed by the fire** itself. PyroCbs can reach astonishing heights (10–15 km high in the case of Australia's 2019–2020 "Black Summer" fires) and produce their own **lightning, thunder, and even rain** – although the rain often evaporates before reaching the ground. Visually, a pyrocumulonimbus appears as a massive anvil-shaped storm cloud arising from the fire, sometimes with *dry lightning* arcing down.
